      <h1>Research Neuroplasticity</h1>

      <h3>Discuss how understanding the principles of neuroplasticity benefits people</h3>
        <p>
          Understanding the principles of neuroplasticity has massive benefits for human life. 
          This has potential to for human life, culture, education to health. Its limits are unknown
        </p> 
      <h3>Discuss how you might engage with the principles of neuroplasticity for your benefit.</h3>
        <p>
          Dreams can be real utilizing principles of neuroplasticity and I think it means 
          If I was to continue to practice and upskill the brain, 
          I can achieve what I think I can’t.
        </p> 
      <h3>What are some of the ways to increase your neuroplasticity?</h3>
        <p>
          Practice, Practice and Practice. Constantly review the material to strengthen the brain. 
          Make sure to put things into context and prioritise what is important. 
          <br>Putting all this into daily habits and making it a part of the normal life.

      <h1>Research Growth Mindset</h1>
      <h3>Discuss what it is and why it is relevant.</h3>
        <p>
          Growth mindset is having the power to believe that you can improve. 
          When one wants to improve oneself sometimes it isn’t or doesn’t feel 
          <br>like it can happen. With effort and difficulty, it improves our neurons 
          in our brain and once we understand and know, then it becomes a norm to want to improve. 
      <h3>In this exploration, did anything surprise you? Change for you?</h3>
        <p>
          I want to make this a norm in my life! I may not be the best tech now, 
          but I want to be able to give my all <br>and all my learnings and goals 
          I set out to be, be the best each time not by skill but through effort in difficult times.
        </p>	
      <h3>How will you integrate growth mindset into your learning journey?</h3>
        <p>
          Taking on board everything I’m learning example putting all this information
          into context and <br>cementing it into everyday life. Making me a function 
          and practicing until it is a habit.
