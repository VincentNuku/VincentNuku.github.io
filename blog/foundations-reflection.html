      <strong>
        What are three new things you have learnt about yourself and your ego due to the core learning?
      </strong>
    </h2>
      <p>
      I have found that I am ill disciplined at taking time to read things properly 
      and that I give up to easily when I get frustrated. 
      I also learnt that If I slow down and show more care in what I do (reading and understanding a question) 
      I actually produce really good work. 
      </p>

    <h2>
      <strong> 
      What are the role of values, empathy, and self-awareness in learning and programming?
      </strong>
    </h2>
      <p>
      Knowing your limits, strengths and weaknessess.Showing an understanding towards others with respect, 
      care and mindfulness. 
      </p>

    <h2>
      <strong>
      What has surprised you the most about the core learning?
      </strong>
    </h2>
      <p>
      Understanding when I get frustrated and what is actually happening to my brain. 
      Then being able to find solutions or options to help ease those tensions 
      e.g. meditation, taking short brakes and understanding my strength and weaknessess.
      </p>

    <h2>
      <strong>
      What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?
      </strong>
    </h2>
      <p>
      Having to research or learn about myself. In our culture we don't really talk about ourselfs like strength
      and weaknessess. Having patience to just sit still and taking time to complete watching videos or reading.
      </p>
    
    <h2>
      <strong>
      Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time 
      focusing on core learning in a web development Bootcamp course?
      </strong>
    </h2>
      <p>
      I think itâ€™s because we will be working with others and we are all at different stages. 
      There are a lot of different people from different backgrounds, cultures and faiths too. 
      We are going to need to lean on our values, empathy and self-awareness. 
      So we can understand each other so we can build a good whanaungatanga relationship to complete our projects.
      </p>

      <strong>
      Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time? 
      Should you have just used that time to practise programming instead? Justify your answer
      </strong>
  </h2>
      <p>
        I have loved every bit of core and it has helped me understand things I go through and reflection has also helped me do it in my coding. I need to show empathy to the code I work with too because it has been bloody hard to understand and figure out. 
        The more I delved into core the more I was able to utilize what I learnt when I struggled in the tech side of things.
