      <p>o	What is Emotional Intelligence?
        Emotional Intelligence (EI) is the ability to manage both your own emotions and understand the emotions of people around you. There are five key elements to EI: self-awareness, self-regulation, motivation, empathy, and social skills.
        o	How is it different to IQ?
        EQ measures an individual's social and emotional competencies or one's ability to recognise one's own and other person's emotional expression. Conversely, IQ measures a person's academic competency and reasoning ability. Emotional Quotient is acquired and improved.
        o	Why is it important?
        Emotional Quotient, or EQ, determines our ability to recognize, differentiate, and manage our emotions and the emotions of others. IQ determines the grades we get in school, and which determine what colleges we can get into, which generally greatly affects our first job.
        With a good balance of EQ and IQ, not only will students be armed with specific skills and knowledge set required to be successful, but they will also be able to communicate, navigate, and address problems more effectively.
