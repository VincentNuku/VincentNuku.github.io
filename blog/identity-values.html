      <p>•	Explain a situation where you have had an ethical decision to make. Discuss how you weighed up the values involved in that decision, the decision you made, and the consequences of your action.

      I recall a time at work when we were taking a group of 20 Rangatahi to San Francisco as a part of our Iwi program. Each student was selected as future leaders because of their participation in events with Iwi, at school and whānau. This one rangatahi had decided they were’nt going to participate in an event, which the event was noted that the students had to particpate or will forfeit their place on the trip. Unfortunately this rangatahi declined to participate and then thier parent decided they wanted there rangatahi to attend the trip even though he declined. The ethical decision was to decline the rangatahi and the request from the parent. The hardest part was weighing up my value of Aroha. Aroha that a rangatahi misses out on an opportunity that may change there future or aroha that this situation would inspire the rangatahi to not rue an opportunity like this again. The heart was sad but the action was correct to decline the rangatahi. I can say; that the rangatahi has made the most of all there opportunties to date and is doing excellent in life. 
      
      
      
      •	Describe how your culture has influenced your values and identity.
      I grew up in the city and I couldn’t speak te reo māori. I loved Haka, Waiata, and Whānau. When I left high school, I moved back to Taranaki with my parents as I couldn’t let my mummy go. I expected the place I was from would be filled with Te reo speakers. I was wrong. from the age of 18 I decided to learn te reo māori and hence 20 years later I find myself to be working for my iwi in creating future opportunities for rangatahi, tamariki and mokopuna through innovation (hence coming to Dev Academy). I can also add standing on my marae as a minita-a-iwi and I do this so my own tamariki and others can continue the work to help enhance our Te Ao Māori.
      
      •	Evaluate your strengths and limitations in terms of your learning and career development
      I find it easy to work in groups then I do alone. I think I bounce of people and can add energy to working groups. I can say I have achieved always being within groups and is the reason why I love whānau.
      I certainly have struggled doing things alone and probably explains my inability to complete 2 Bachelors that only have years’ work to complete. A mental blockage that I’m not good enough to go further when I get stuck, not enough patience and a lack of consistency to push out bad habits.
      •	Identify which of your strengths might help you in your learning journey and how they intersect with learning obstacles.
      Team environments with others having different strengths to get through challenges and work. I know I get told that I always have confidence to pick others up even though I lack it to pick myself up.
      •	Share an example from your experience of where you were trying to work productively with others, but there was resistance or tension. Discuss the strategies you used at that time, how effective they were, and your reflections on what other strategies you would try now and why.
      There was this one time maybe a few, when a colleague just wouldn’t tell or give updates to keep us in the loop of what was happening at work. The colleague was afraid the manager would know it was them or just felt impowered. But every time it came to the moment when the manager would need us to help it was too late, we had no clue what the manager wanted. So, the colleague would get blasted and cry. It wasn’t an effective strategy as the colleague is now the manager and the person who replaced the now manager is doing the same thing. 
      The strategy I use now is to approach the manager and colleague openly as I believe I am a valued member to the group who works hard and the strengths I bring are commitment, loyalty and honesty.
