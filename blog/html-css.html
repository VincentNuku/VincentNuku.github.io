  What are the best practices associated with using classes vs. ids?
</h1>

<h2>What is a Class</h2>
  <p>
    The class is an attribute which specifies one or more class names 
    for an HTML element. The class attribute can be used on any<br> HTML 
    element. The class name can be used by CSS and JavaScript to perform 
    certain tasks for elements with the specified class name.
  </p>
  <br>
  <p>
    An example - attaching multiple class to multiple elements and then 
    being able to attach the class to other <br>elements for the same 
    design e.g. font-weight 
  </p> 

<h2>What is an ID</h2>
  <p>
    The id global attribute defines an identifier (ID) which must be unique 
    in the whole document. Its purpose is to identify the <br>element when linking 
    (using a fragment identifier), scripting, or styling (with CSS)
  </p>
  <br>
  <p>
    An example - Within a ul added an id=nav to the li. This allowed style to 
    the element e.g. the ul that is now unique to everything else.
  </p>

<h2>What are the best practices associated with using them?</h2>   
  <p>
    When you're working with CSS, there are no specific reasons forcing you to 
    use an ID over a class. However, it is best practice to only use <br>IDs if you 
    want a style to apply to one element on the web page, and to use classes 
    if you want a style to apply to multiple elements
