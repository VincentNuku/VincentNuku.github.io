  What are the best practices associated with using classes vs. ids?
</h1>
<h2>What is a Class</h2>
  <p>
  The class is an attribute which specifies one or more class names for an HTML element. 
  The class attribute can be used on any HTML element. 
  The class name can be used by CSS and JavaScript to perform certain tasks for elements with the specified class name
  </p>
  <p>An example - attaching multiple class to multiple elements and then being able to attach the class to other elements for the same design e.g. font-weight </p> 

<h3>What is an ID</h3>
  <p>The id global attribute defines an identifier (ID) which must be unique in the whole document. 
     Its purpose is to identify the element when linking (using a fragment identifier), scripting, or styling (with CSS)
    </p>
  <p>An example - Within a ul added an id=nav to the li. This allowed style to the element e.g. the ul that is now unique to everything else.
  </p>

<h4>What are the best practices associated with using them?</h4>   
  <p>When you're working with CSS, there are no specific reasons forcing you to use an ID over a class. 
   However, it is best practice to only use IDs if you want a style to apply to one element on the web page, and to use classes if you want a style to apply to multiple elements
