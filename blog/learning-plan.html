      <h1> •	What is your long-term goal or career pathway?</h1>h1>
        <p>To use the skills of web development to improve Iwi structure e.g., branches and the concepts of repository cloning to enhance structure within Iwi and to teach rangatahi and tamariki the fundamentals of web development.</p>
        •	A description of your strengths and limitations concerning learning
        Persistence with problem solving and eagerness to learn. Limitations concerning learning is not being able to make habitual changes e.g., getting close but falling off. 
        •	What skills (non-technical - human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?
        Forming healthy working and living habits 
        •	A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme. This should include:
        o	An explanation of how you will manage yourself to work productively and safely with other learners, facilitators, and industry/community representatives 
        – My thinking is getting too bootcamp and I can be fully committed whole heartedly with time and being present in the moment.
        o	What you will do when things are building up and starting to get to you
         – Cry to my wife and say poor me, and then get told to get back and reach out for help.
        •	A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way
        To my facilitators and teammates – I’m open like a book, good or bad (I don’t know lol)
        •	A description of what you expect from the facilitation team
        Understanding, shows Empathy and hopefully a kick in the backside to get things moving if I’m dawdling.
        •	Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are committed to other things. For example, you might have whānau commitments like school drop-offs. It's important to plan these in.
        I’ve had a few already with tangi in our whānau and I had to make a call not to go because I wasn’t feeling confident enough to step away from my studies. I have made a commitment and this commitment will enhance my whānau and our future.
