      <h1>Learning Plan</h1>
      <br>
      <h3>What is your long-term goal or career pathway?</h2>
        <p>
          To use the skills of web development to improve Iwi structure e.g., branches and 
          the concepts of repository cloning to enhance structure within Iwi and to 
          teach rangatahi and tamariki the fundamentals of web development.
        </p>

      <h3>A description of your strengths and limitations concerning learning</h2>
        <p>
          Persistence with problem solving and eagerness to learn. 
          Limitations concerning learning is not being able to make habitual 
          changes e.g., getting close but falling off.
        </p> 

      <h3>What skills (non-technical - human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy</h3>
        <p>
          Forming healthy working and living habits
        </p> 

      <h3>A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme.<br> 
          Manage yourself to work productively and safely with other learners, 
          facilitators, and industry/community representatives</h3>
        <p>
          My thinking is getting too bootcamp and I can be fully committed 
          whole heartedly with time and being present in the moment.
        </p>

      <h3>What you will do when things are building up and starting to get to you</h3>
        <p>
          Cry to my wife and say poor me, and then get told to get back and reach out for help.
        </p>

      <h3>A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way</h3>
        <p>
          To my facilitators and teammates – I’m open like a book, good or bad (I don’t know lol)
        </p>
      
      <h3>A description of what you expect from the facilitation team</h3>
        <p>
          shows Empathy and hopefully a kick in the backside to get things moving if I’m dawdling.
        </p>
      
      <h3>Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are committed to other things. 
          <br>For example, you might have whānau commitments like school drop-offs. It's important to plan these in. </h3>
        <p>
          I’ve had a few already with tangi in our whānau and I had to make a call not to go 
          because I wasn’t feeling confident enough to step away from my studies.<br> I have made 
          a commitment and this commitment will enhance my whānau and our future.
        </p>

      <h1>Learning Plan Bootcamp</h1>
        <br>
      <h3>What is your long term goal and/or career pathway?</h3>
        <p>
          There are 2 things here I would like to talk about 
      
          <li>So currently Iwi in Taranaki are looking at the future and how to grow our skills section innovation. 
          One of the plans is to collate data and I think It may be something <br>I would like to use the skills 
          I gain in here like servers, back-end and front end.
          </li>
          <li>
          I currently work for my iwi and our goal has been to increase the numbers of maori 
          working in the IT or tech industry. My role is with young adults, youth and children. 
          <br>I would like to help advance these young people to hopefully further their education 
          by doing web development and so on.
          </li>
        </p>
      <h3>What do you think your biggest strengths and limitations will be in Bootcamp?</h3>
        <p>
          I’m a team player and I like giving positive energy and vibes to my team mates or those around me. 
          <br>I think my never say die attitude gets me through hard stages and willingness to keep going even 
          when I feel I should give up. <br>My limits are not being able to get an early understanding 
          of where to start and this something <br>I’ve realised has burdened me right through foundations 
          especially in the technical sides.
        </p>
      <h3>What do you think your biggest non-technical challenge at Bootcamp will be?</h3>
        <p>
          Trying not fall into my shall when I struggle. 
          It’s like I slip out of the moment and all that energy I give to to others fades towards 
          myself e.g self-doubt
        </p>
      <h3>What non-technical skills - human skills - would you like to see <br>developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?</h3>
        <p>
          I would like to develop and improve receiving feedback and how to not respond negatively to 
          feedback. How I can take the feedback and use it to benefit my progress.
          <br>Reflecting is something I have found I like and would like to enhance in my everyday life.
        </p>
      <h3>What are your expectations from the Bootcamp team?</h3>
      <p>
          That your going to push me beyond my limits that I never Imagined going! 
      </p>
      <h3>What are your expectations of yourself on Bootcamp</h3>
      <p>
        To ask questions early in the piece. I noticed I never asked question hence my timing on my 
        work needed extensions every sprint. <br>I’m a sociable person and I hope that
        I can mix with others that will awhi me and I can do the same like wise for them. I love whaanau.
