    <h1>JavaScript Fundamentals</h1> 
    <h2><em>What is JavaScript </em></h2>
    <p>JavaScript is a coding language that is used to communicate instructions to a computer.</p>
    <p>If you have ever been on an interactive webpage or even a game it most likely because of JavaScript</p>
  
    <h2>JavaScripts relationship with HTML and CSS</h2>
    <p>HTML forms the body of a webpage like the Web Content, Web Images, Web Links and on it's on is like black and white</p>
    <p>CSS gives the web style like Font Colors, Font types and postioning of content. Like color t.v being introduced back in the days</p>
    <p>Now JavaScript has the pop up messages and the autocompletes like when you type one thing and it auto completes it like a smart t.v</p>
    <p>Well actually JavaScript can change what is seen on a page and can react to user input like buttons</p>

    <h2>What is control flow and loops </h2>
    <p>Control flow refers to a order in which the instructions in your program a executed</p>
    <p>My example is a Whaikorero: A whaikorero starts with a Tauparapara. Then acknowledment of those who have passed.
    <p>Followed by greeting everyone and the kaupapa or reason we are gathered It finishes with a waiata and a final acknowledge of everyone.</p>
    </p>
    <p>Loops are like repeats.In stead of repeating a code over and over again I can turn it into a loop saves you from repeating yourself</p>
    
    <h3>The DOM</h3>

    <p>The DOM is Document - HTML on your webpage</p>
    <p>Object Model - the way it represents the document and it's elements</p>
    <p>I like to look at like whakapapa - Geneaology and the DOM you can take code out and use it in your code</p>
    <p>Like whakapapa using it in waiata</p>

    <h3>Arrays and Objects</h3>
    <p>Objects are used to represent a “thing” in your code. That could be a person, a car, a building, a book, a character in a game — basically anything that is made up or can be defined by a set of characteristics.</p> 
    <p>In objects, these characteristics are called properties that consist of a key and a value.</p>
    <p>We use arrays whenever we want to create and store a list of multiple items in a single variable. Arrays are especially useful when creating ordered collections where items in the collection can be accessed by their numerical position in the list.</p>
    <p>Just as object properties can store values of any primitive data type (as well as an array or another object), so too can arrays consist of strings, numbers, booleans, objects, or even other arrays.</p>

   <h3>what functions are and why they are helpful</h3>
   <p>A function is a sequence of commands that can be reused together later in a program.</p> 
   <p>Functions name the sequence of commands and dictate what code is executed.</p> 
   <p>Functions also allow for separation of code, so we can easily use it again throughout a program</p>
