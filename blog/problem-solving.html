<h1>
  Blocked on a simple problem
</h1>
  <p>
    When I look at a code and it has a lot of lines I automatically think big. I don't know why but I just do.
  
    Firstly I have already over thought what I'm trying to solve as I automatically thought It's big and put myself out of depth.
    
    I found that I needed to delve into  research. 
    Looking online at other sources of information and explanations to help me so I can understand e.g. variables
  
    Understanding how to navigate using the material provided is good, 
    but still figuring out how to get the head around coding formats 
  </p>

<h2>Elegantly solved a problem</h2>
  <p>
    This is really difficult as I had difficulty with nearly every problem I had to solve. 
    To solve a problem I would need to go over what is required in the soluton. 
    Write down how I could possibly solve the problem and some were easier than others.
    I can say I went through a lot of mental battles on a lot of the problems especially half-way through the JavaScript Kata.
    I would say If there is one thing I got is persistence.
  </p>

<h2>Reflect on how confident you feel using each of these problem-solving techniques/processes</h2>
  
<h4>Pseudocode</h4>   
  <p> Pseudocode was great and helped me start breaking down problems and writing what I needed to do </p>

<h4>Try Something</h4>
  <p>
    A lot of Try Something this sprint but it was really helpful to do
  </p>

<h4>Rubber ducky method</h4>
  <P>
     never got around to putting this in practice much - something that can be practiced more
    </P>

<h4>Reading error messages</h4>
  <p>
    A lot of errors and a lot of annoying errors like syntax
  </p>

<h4>Console.logging</h4>
  <p>
    It wasn't until Built-in Methods that console.logging became clear. 
    Something clicked as I have seen it used in videos and explanations but I never understod it.
    When I used it for the first it was like a wow I see now moment
  </p>

<h4>Googling</h4>
  <p>
    Koro google always does a great job. Learning how to develop my information I seek in search better
  </p>

<h4>Asking your peers for help</h4>
  <p>
    I need to find peers who are great coders with patience to help me haha..
    I enjoy asking my peers for help also get to know them better
  </p>
<h4>Asking coaches for help</h4>
  <p>
    I need to be more vulnerable and not scared or shy to ask the coaches. It's like I feel embarrased. 
    Something I need to break out of.
  </p>
<h4>Improving your process with reflection</h4>
  <p>Is it normal to not stop reflecting on what your doing? even when you sleep? lol</p>
